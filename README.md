# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles. 

## Installation
To install, clone into your home directory along with submodules with `git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/shanereilly/.dotfiles.git`. Run `~/.dotfiles/install.sh`. Note, this script will remove all current dotfiles stored in their default locations and recreate them as symlinks.
